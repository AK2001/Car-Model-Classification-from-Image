# Car-Model-Classification-from-Image

### This repository contains a project created by me as part of my final year dissertation in Computer Science.

**Aims**
---
The aim of this project is to create a machine learning model using Transfer Learning method, in order to be able to classify models of car based on a given car image. 

**Branch main-Backend:**
Contains the implementation of a backend server, made with FastAPI, which defines the API route that allows the machine learning model to be created, loaded and classify the user-provided image.

**Branch main-Frontend:**
Is the frontend part of the project. A React.JS application, which provides the user with a responsive UI, through which they can upload an image of a car and get back the Top1 and Top3 label predictions.
